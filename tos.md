## Terms of Service

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the use of this Discord bot (the "Bot"). By inviting or using the Bot, you agree to these Terms.

### 1. Access and Scope
- The Bot provides dictionary and related utilities in Discord servers.
- The Bot requests the following scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands` 
- Standard permissions include reading message history, sending messages, embedding links, attaching files, and, where enabled by server admins, reading message content to enable usage monitoring features.

### 2. Acceptable Use
- Do not use the Bot to harass, spam, or violate Discord’s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service.
- Do not attempt to reverse-engineer, exploit, or abuse the Bot or its infrastructure.
- You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to submit any content (e.g., terms/definitions/images) stored by the Bot.
- Do not submit any illegal content or content which violates Discord’s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service to be stored by the Bot.

### 3. Content and Data
- Terms, definitions, and related metadata (e.g., creator user ID, timestamps) are stored per guild to provide the dictionary functionality.
- When monitoring is enabled by admins, the Bot may access message content transiently to detect term usage. The Bot stores only aggregated usage counters/metadata, not full messages.
- The Bot does not provide data outside the guild except as needed to fulfill features (e.g., generating embeds/images in the guild).

### 4. Admin Controls and Data Deletion
- Server administrators can manage and delete data at any time using in-bot commands or request manual deletion at the support Discord server.

### 5. Availability and Changes
- The Bot is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis; uptime is not guaranteed.
- Features, permissions, and stored data structures may change. We may update these Terms from time to time; continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
- Data stored by the bot may be lost or deleted at any time; do not store valuable information

### 6. Liability and Disclaimer
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Bot is provided without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of the Bot.

### 7. Contact
For questions or assistance (including data deletion requests), contact the Bot maintainer.

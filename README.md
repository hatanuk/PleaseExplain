# PleaseExplain

Ever tried reading a Discord conversation before asking yourself, 'What the hell do these words even mean? What are they saying? Is this communication?"
PleaseExplain is a Discord bot which offers a solution to this mayhem by allowing you to define certain words or phrases. 
Now you don't need to be versed in seven layers of irony and inside jokes to participate in a regular conversion!

## App Commands

`/define [term] [definition]`
Simple as it sounds. Associates a [term], which could be a word or phrase, with a specific definition. Feel free to include examples.

`/undefine [term]`
Removes that term from the dictionary.

`/dictionary`
Displays all of the terms in your server.

`/random`
Displays a random definition. Go crazy, learn some new vocabulary.

`/usage_counting [on/off]`
Controls whether the bot reads messages to count the amount of times a term has been used.

`/clear_data [type]`
Permenantly removes certain type of data (usage, dictionary, etc.) held by the bot.
